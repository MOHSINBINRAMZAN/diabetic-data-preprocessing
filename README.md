**Diabetic Data Preprocessing**
This project focuses on preprocessing diabetic patient data to ensure it is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis or model training. Effective preprocessing is critical in medical data analysis to enhance the accuracy and reliability of subsequent analyses or machine learning models.

**Features**

**Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and duplicate records.
**
Normalization and Standardization:** Scaling numerical features for improved model performance.

**Categorical Encoding**: Converting categorical variables into numerical representations.

**Feature Engineering:** Creating new features that may enhance the predictive power of the dataset.

**Visualization**: Graphical representation of data distributions and relationships.

**Project Structure**
